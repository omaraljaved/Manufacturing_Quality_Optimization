## Overview:
In quality engineering, optimizing manufacturing processes to enhance product quality is of paramount importance. This script showcases how optimization techniques can be applied to address this challenge. The Simulated Annealing algorithm is employed to iteratively search for optimal values of manufacturing parameters that lead to improved quality metrics.

## Features:
1. Utilizes the Simulated Annealing algorithm for optimization.
2. Defines a manufacturing process objective function based on defects and waste.
3. Seeks to minimize defects and waste while maximizing production efficiency.
4. Provides insights into the effect of different parameters on the optimization process through temperature and quality value plots.

## Dependencies:
1. NumPy: Used for numerical operations.
2. Matplotlib: Used for creating plots.
